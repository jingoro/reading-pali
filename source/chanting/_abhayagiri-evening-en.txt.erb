[00:12.5] (To the Bl`essed One,) th`e Lord, who f^ully `attained perfect enl`ightenment,
[00:27.0] To th`e Teaching, which he exp`ound`ed so well,
[00:39.0] And to th`e Blessed One’s disc^iples who have pr`acticed well,
[00:51.5] To these—th`e Buddha, th`e Dhamma, `and the S^angha—
[01:07.5] We render w`ith offerings our r^ightful h``omage.
[01:21.0] It is w^ell for us that the Bl`essed One, having attained l`iber^ation,
[01:34.2] Still had c`ompassion for later g^ener``ations.
[01:50.0] May th`ese simple of^ferings be acc`epted
[02:01.1] For `our long-lasting benefit and f`or the h^appiness it g``ives us.
[02:13.8] Th`e Lord, th`e Perfectly Enl^ightened and Bl`essed One—
[02:25.0] `I render homage t`o the B^uddha, the Bl`essed One.
[02:30.8]   (Bow.)
[02:42.5] (Th`e Teaching,) so c`ompletely expl^ained by him—
[02:50.5] I b``ow t`o th`e Dh`amma.
[02:50.8]   (Bow.)
[03:05.0] Th`e Blessed One’s disc^iples, who have pr`acticed well—
[03:13.0] I b``ow t`o th`e S`angha.
[03:13.8]   (Bow.)

[03:18.0] ## Preliminary Homage

[03:28.1] (N^ow let us pay preliminary homage to the B`uddha.)
[04:01.5] [H^om^age to th`e Bl`essed,] N^oble, `and P`erfectly Enl^ightened One. (Three times.)

[04:24.0] ## Recollection of the Buddha

(N^ow let us chant the recollection of the B`uddha.)
[`A good word] of th`e Blessed One’s r`eput^ation has spread as f`ollows:
He, th`e Bl`essed One, is indeed the P^ure One, th`e Perfectly Enl^ightened One;
He is `impeccable `in conduct and `understanding, the `Acc^omplished One, th`e Knower ^of th`e Worlds;
He trains perfectly th`ose who w^ish t^o b`e trained; he is Teacher of g^ods and h`umans;
he is Awake and Holy.

## Supreme Praise of the Buddha

[04:31.0]   [N^ow let us chant the supreme praise of the B`uddha.]
[Th`e Buddha,] th`e truly w^orthy one, `endowed with such ^excellent qu`alities,
Whose being is composed of p`urity, transcendental w^isdom, and comp`assion,
Who has `enlightened the _wise_ like th`e sun aw^akening the l`otus—
I bow `my head to th`at peaceful ch^ief of c`onquerors.
Th`e Buddha, who is th`e safe, s`ecure r^efuge of a``ll beings—
As th`e First Object of R`ecollection, `I venerate him with b^owed head.
I am indeed the Buddha’s s`ervant, th`e Buddha is my L^ord `and Guide.
Th`e Buddha is sorrow’s destr`oyer, who bestows bl^ess^ings `on me.
To th`e Buddha I d^edicate this b`o`dy and life,
And in d`evotion I w`ill _walk_ the Buddha’s p^ath of `aw`akening.
For me there is no other r`efuge, th`e Buddha is my ^excellent r`efuge.
By th`e utterance of th`is _truth_, may I grow in the M^ast`er’s Way.
By my d`evotion to the B`uddha, and the` blessing of this pr^actice—
By `its power, may `all obstacles be ^ov`ercome.
  (Bowing:)
By body, speech, `or mind,
For whatever wr`ong action I have c`ommitted towards the B`uddha,
May my `acknowledgement of fault be acc^epted,
That `in the future there may be r`estraint regarding the B`uddha.

## Recollection of the Dhamma

(N^ow let us chant the recollection of the Dh`amma.)
[Th`e Dhamma] is w`ell exp^ounded by the Bl`essed One,
Apparent here `and now, timeless, `encouraging inv`estig^ation,
Leading `inwards, to be `experienced ind`ividually b^y th`e wise.

## Supreme Praise of the Dhamma

(N^ow let us chant the supreme praise of the Dh`amma.)
[It `is excellent] because it is “w`ell exp^ounded,”
And it can be d`ivided int`o Path and Fruit, Practice and L`iber^ation.
Th`e Dhamma holds those who `uphold it from f`alling int`o del^usion.
I revere th`e excellent t^eaching, that which removes d`arkness—
Th`e Dhamma, which is the s`upreme, secure r^efuge of a``ll beings—
As th`e Second Object of R`ecollection, `I venerate it with b^owed head.
I am indeed the Dhamma’s s`ervant, th`e Dhamma is my L^ord `and Guide.
Th`e Dhamma is sorrow’s destr`oyer, and it bestows bl^ess^ings `on me.
To th`e Dhamma I d^edicate this b`o`dy and life.
And in d`evotion I w`ill _walk_ this excellent w^ay of Truth.
For me there is no other r`efuge, th`e Dhamma is my ^excellent r`efuge.
By th`e utterance of th`is truth, may I grow in the M^ast`er’s Way.
By my d`evotion to the Dh`amma, and th`e blessing of this pr^actice—
By `its power, may `all obstacles be ^ov`ercome.
  (Bowing:)
By body, speech, `or mind,
For whatever wr`ong action I have c`ommitted towards the Dh`amma,
May my `acknowledgement of fault be acc^epted,
That `in the future there may be r`estraint regarding the Dh`amma.

## Recollection of the Sangha

(N^ow let us chant the recollection of the S`angha.)
[They are th`e Blessed One’s disc^iples,] who have pr`acticed well,
Who have practiced dir`ectly,
Who have practiced ins^ightfully,
_Those_ who pr^actice with int`egrity—
That is the f`our pairs, the eight kinds of n^obl`e beings—
_These_ are th`e Blessed One’s disc^iples.
Such ones `are worthy of gifts, worthy of h`ospit^ality, worthy of `offerings, worthy ^of r`espect;
They give occasion for `inc`omparable g^oodness to ar`ise `in the world.

## Supreme Praise of the Sangha

(Now let us chant the supreme praise of the Sangha.)
[_Born_ `of the Dh^amma,] th`at Saṅgha which has pr^act`iced well,
The field of th`e Sangha formed `of _eight_ kinds of n^oble beings,
Guided in body `and _mind_ `by excellent mor^ality and v`irtue.
I revere that `assembly of n^oble beings p`erfected in p`urity.
Th`e Saṅgha which is the s`upreme, s`ecure r^efuge of a``ll beings—
As th`e Third Object of R`ecoll^ection, `I venerate it with b^owed head.
I am indeed the S`angha's servant, th`e Sangha is my L^ord `and Guide.
Th`e Sangha is sorrow’s destr`oyer and it bestows bl^ess^ings `on me.
To th`e Sangha I d^edicate this b`od`y and life.
And in d`evotion I w`ill _walk_ the well-practiced w^ay of th`e S`angha.
For me there is no other r`efuge, th`e Sangha is my ^excellent r`efuge.
By th`e utterance of th`is _truth_, may I grow in the M^ast`er’s W`ay.
By my d`evotion to the S`angha, and th`e blessing `of this pr^actice—
By `its power, may `all obstacles be ^ov`ercome.
(Bowing:)
By body, speech, `or mind,
For whatever wr`ong action I have c`ommitted towards the S`angha,
May my `acknowledgement of fault be acc^epted,
That `in the future there may be r`estraint regarding the S`angha.
