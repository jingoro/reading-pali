[03:21.0] Whose being is composed of p`urity, transcendental w^isdom, and comp`assion,
[03:29.2] Who has `enlightened the _wise_ like th`e sun aw^akening the l`otus—
[03:37.0] I bow `my head to th`at peaceful ch^ief of c`onquerors.
[03:42.7] Th`e Buddha, who is th`e safe, s`ecure r^efuge of a``ll beings—

[05:31.2] Leading `inwards, to be `experienced ind`ividually b^y th`e wise.

[05:38.8] ## Supreme Praise of the Dhamma

[05:44.7] [It `is excellent] because it is “w`ell exp^ounded,”
[05:51.0] And it can be d`ivided int`o Path and Fruit, Practice and L`iber^ation.
[05:58.5] Th`e Dhamma holds those who `uphold it from f`alling int`o del^usion.
[06:04.8] I revere th`e excellent t^eaching, that which removes d`arkness—
[06:11.3] Th`e Dhamma, which is the s`upreme, secure r^efuge of a``ll beings—
[06:18.0] As th`e Second Object of R`ecollection, `I venerate it with b^owed head.

[07:06.2] By my d`evotion to the Dh`amma, and th`e blessing of this pr^actice—
[07:13.3] By `its power, may `all obstacles be ^ov`ercome.
[07:19.0]   (Bowing:)
[07:20.1] By body, speech, `or mind,
[07:22.7] For whatever wr`ong action I have c`ommitted towards the Dh`amma,

[07:35.0] ## Recollection of the Sangha

[07:38.8] (N^ow let us chant the recollection of the S`angha.)
[07:43.8] [They are th`e Blessed One’s disc^iples,] who have pr`acticed well,
[07:51.0] Who have practiced dir`ectly,
[07:54.4] Who have practiced ins^ightfully,
[07:57.6] _Those_ who pr^actice with int`egrity—
[08:01.4] That is the f`our pairs, the eight kinds of n^obl`e beings—
[08:07.0] _These_ are th`e Blessed One’s disc^iples.
[08:11.0] Such ones `are worthy of gifts, worthy of h`ospit^ality, worthy of `offerings, worthy ^of r`espect;
[08:21.7] They give occasion for `inc`omparable g^oodness to ar`ise `in the world.

[08:29.0] ## Supreme Praise of the Sangha

[08:29.6] (Now let us chant the supreme praise of the Sangha.)
[08:35.5] [_Born_ `of the Dh^amma,] th`at Saṅgha which has pr^act`iced well,
[08:42.4] The field of th`e Sangha formed `of _eight_ kinds of n^oble beings,
[08:49.4] Guided in body `and _mind_ `by excellent mor^ality and v`irtue.
[08:56.3] I revere that `assembly of n^oble beings p`erfected in p`urity.
[09:04.1] Th`e Saṅgha which is the s`upreme, s`ecure r^efuge of a``ll beings—
[09:11.0] As th`e Third Object of R`ecoll^ection, `I venerate it with b^owed head.
